Feature: Main Modules of the Application

    As an admin, I want to access the main modules of the app.


    #* AC: Admin users should see 3 modules: Dashboard, Users, Books

  
    # TODO: Verify admins can see 3 main modules (Dashboard, Users, and Books)
    

    #? Should there be more scenarios for this user story? Feel free to add more scenarios.
