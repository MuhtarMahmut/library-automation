Feature: Add Users Functionality

    As an admin, I should be able to add users on the "Users" page.

    #* AC: Admin users should be able to see the Add User button on the Users page
    #* AC: Admin should be able to add student user and admin user to the application

    #! Please make sure to set the status of the newly added to "Inactive" after the automation is done
