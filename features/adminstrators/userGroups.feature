Feature: User Groups Filtering

    As an admin, I should be able to filter the user groups on the "Users" page.

    #* AC1: Admins should be able to filter the user groups on the Users page
    #* AC2: There should be three options under the user groups dropdown menu: ALL, Librarian, and Students


    #TODO: Analyze the user story and create acceptance criteria yourself!


    #TODO: Create scenarios that cover all the acceptance criteria
