Feature: User Groups Filtering

    As an admin, I should be able to filter the user groups on the "Users" page.

    #* AC1: Admins should be able to filter the user groups on the Users page
    #* AC2: There should be three options under the user groups dropdown menu: ALL, Librarian, and Students


    #TODO: Verify that the User Group dropdown is displayed on the Users page

    #TODO: Verify that the "ALL" option is selected by default on the Users page

    #TODO: Verify that the User Group dropdown menue has "ALL", "Librarian", and "Students" those three options

    #TODO: Verify that after the admin filters the user groups by student, then all group columns should have the value of "Students"
