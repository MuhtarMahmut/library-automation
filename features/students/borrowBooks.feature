Feature: Borrowing books

    As a student, I should be able to borrow books on the "Books" Page.


    #* AC1: The Borrow Book button is displayed in the books page
    #* AC2: The Borrow Book button should be disabled after user clicks it
    #* AC3: The Borrow Book button should be enabled for the books that the student can borrow
    #* AC4: The books student borrowed should be displayed in the Borrowing Books page


    # TODO: Verify that the Borrow Book Button is displayed on the Books page

    # TODO: Verify that the Borrow Book button is disabled if the book is already borrowed by a student

    # TODO: Verify that the Borrow Book button is enabled if the book is not borrowed by a student yet

    # TODO: Verify that the name of the student is displayed in the Borrowed By column once the student borrows the book

    # TODO: Verify that the book is displayed in the Borrowing Books page after the student click the Borrow Book button

    #TODO: Fell free to add more...
